# Tallinn_Parallax

This parallax website includes fixed images in the background.
you can keep in place and you can scroll down the page to see different parts of the image.
I divided the whole page into four different sections.
I Set 4 background images from beautiful Tallinn.
I aligned the text for different sections, set margin and padding.
I add background-position and other CSS elements and properties to create a parallax effect.
